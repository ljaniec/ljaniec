I am Łukasz Janiec, a PhD student at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, and also a robotics software developer.

-    🔭 Currently, I am engaged in research focused on the automated synthesis of hierarchical control systems for multiple mobile robots with a discrete event supervisor, utilizing a space-as-a-resource approach.
-    🌱 I am actively enhancing my skills in advanced ROS 2 utilities and the Nav2 stack - if you have open issues suited to my skills, feel free to contact me!
-    👯 I am seeking collaboration opportunities for research projects related to multiple mobile robot systems, aiming for publication in IEEE or similar-level journals.
-    💬 Feel free to approach me with your research and robotics project ideas; I am enthusiastic about discussing and providing assistance.
-    📫 You can reach me via email (available in the profile), and I also have a university email in the format `name.surname@pwr.edu.pl`.
